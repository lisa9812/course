## Pulse Heart Rate

### Video 1.1: Basic Heart Anatomy

The Heart's Location within the Thoracic Cavity

- The heart is a _hollow, muscular, cone-shaped organ_
  - General location
    1. Positioned in the **mediastinum**
    1. within the **pericardial cavity**
    1. between the **pleural cavities**
  - enclosed by the **pericardium**
    1. function –anchors &amp; protects the heart
- Esophagus and trachea are posterior to the heart



The Heart's Internal Structure

- 4 **chambers**, or compartments
  - Two superior chambers, or **atria**
  - Two inferior chambers, or **ventricles**
  - To prevent mixing of blood between chambers-- **interatrial septum** and  **interventricular septum**
    - Ventricular walls are thicker than atrial walls because they are responsible for pumping blood into the systemic and pulmonary circulations
  - Right atrium
    - Receives _deoxygenated_ blood from the body from three vessels
      1. **Superior vena cava**
      1. **Inferior vena cava**
      1. **Coronary sinus**
    - From the right atrium, blood goes to the right ventricle
  - Right ventricle
    - Pumps _deoxygenated_ blood into the pulmonary trunk
  - Left atrium
    - receives _oxygenated_ blood via the **pulmonary veins** m
  - Left ventricle
    - Pumps _oxygenated_ blood into the aorta
    - Left ventricular walls are thicker than right ventricular walls because they need to contract with more force in order to send blood throughout the systemic circulation
- The **systemic circulation** supplies the tissues and organs of the body with _oxygenated_ blood
  - the newly _deoxygenated_ blood returns to the right atrium by the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and coronary sinus

### Video 1.2a: Your Beating Heart

The Heart at a Microscopic Level
- 2 functional units (syncytia):
  - the **atrial syncytium**
  - the **ventricular syncytium**
  - Atria contract, then ventricles contract, then the heart relaxes
- Two types of cells in the heart wall
  - **Contracting cells**
  - Cells that generate an *electrical signal*
    - Form the **cardiac conduction system**:
      - Occurs in each heartbeat


The Cardiac Conduction System

- Starts at the **sinoatrial node**(SA node)
  - Location:
  - Part of the cardiac conduction system that generates an electrical signal most rapidly
  - Spreads signal over entire atrial syncytium causing atrial contraction
- Signal spreads to the **atrioventricular node**(AV node)
- Signal passes through the **atrioventricular bundle**(AV bundle)
- Signal arrives in the **interventricular septum**
  - Passes through two **bundle branches**(right and left)
- At apex, the fibers branch extensively, forming **Purkinje fibers**
- **Electrocardiograms**(ECGs) assess the cardiac conduction system
  - Determine if electrical activity of the heart is working properly



### Video 1.2b: ECG Demo

- ECGs are devices we use to detect the electrical activity in the heart
  - **Electrodes**are placed on the body
    - 2 _upper limb leads_
    - 2 _lower limb leads_
    - 6 _precordial leads_
    - Allows you to look at the heart from 12 different angles-\&gt; can pinpoint location of abnormality, if present
- The current arising from the SA node is a positive current, called **depolarization**
  - The positive current passes through the atrial walls
  - A negative current restores the electrical potential of the atrium back to normal after the passing of the positive current, this is called **repolarization**
- **Normal Sinus Rhythm**
  - **P wave**: first wave
  - **QRS complex:** second group of waves
    - Consists of the Q, R, S waves
  - **T Wave:** third wave
  - **Isoelectric lines**–occur when there is no change occurring in the electrical state of the heart (i.e., no depolarization or repolarization is occurring)
    - Between P wave and QRS complex
    - Between QRS complex and T wave



### Video 1.3a: Heart Valves, Part 1

- Heart valves ensure that blood flows in one direction through the heart
  - Composed of _dense, fibrous connective tissue_
  - covered in **endocardium-**
- Heart has _4 valves_- organized as two pairs
  - **Atrioventricular valves**(AV valves)
    - **tricuspid valve** 右心房心室之间
    - **mitral valve** 左心房心室之间
    - Close when ventricles contract and the _pressure in the ventricles exceeds pressure in the atria_
      - **chordae tendinae**:
      - **papillary muscles** contract along with ventricles, creating tension in the chordae tendinae, preventing the free edges of the valves from swinging upward into the atria
    - Open after ventricular relaxation, _when atrial pressure exceeds ventricular pressure_
  - **Semilunar valves** (SL valves) :Blood passes from right ventricle to the pulmonary trunk and from the left ventricle into the aorta
    - **pulmonic valve**
    - **aortic valve**
    - When closed, the cusps fall into the center of the pulmonary trunk and aorta to prevent backflow of blood from the vessel into the ventricle
    - When the ventricles contract, pressure in them increases- when _ventricular pressure exceeds pressure in the aorta and pulmonary trunk, the semilunar valves open_
    - When the ventricles relax, pressure drops- when _the ventricular pressure falls below the pressure in the aorta and pulmonary trunk, the semilunar valves close_

Movement of valves during the cardiac cycle

- When the heart is relaxed
  - the semilunar valves are closed and the AV valves are open
    - blood is coming back to the right atrium through the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and coronary sinus
    - On the left side, blood is returning to the heart from the pulmonary veins from the lungs
- Atria contract
  - Pressure in atria increases
- Atria relax, ventricles contract
  - Pressure in ventricles exceeds pressure in atria
  - Pressure continues to climb as ventricles continue to contract -\&gt; ventricular pressure exceeds pressure in aorta and pulmonary trunk
- Ventricles stop contracting, start to relax
- Cycle repeats
- When valves close, they cause vibrations to occur in the blood that&#39;s passing through the heart
  - Vibrations are carried to the body&#39;s surface and can be heard with a stethoscope
  - **sound one:**
  - **sound two:**



### Video 1.3c, Assessing Heart Rate Demo

- **Auscultation**:
- The heart is positioned deep to the sternum, slightly to the left of the midline in the chest cavity
  - **the apex:**
    - Location:
    - Orientation:
    - **point of maximal impulse**- the most accurate place to check heart rate
- Feeling the heart rate, or **palpating**, assesses the number of beats per minute
- _Auscultation_ allows assessment of heart rate as well as heart sounds
  - Heart sounds include **sound one**and **sound two**, usually called **S1**an **S2**
    - **S1**
    - **S2**



- Physicians often auscultate in multiple locations to assess heart sounds related to the specific valves
  - **aortic valve:**
  - **pulmonic valve:**
  - **tricuspid valve:**
  - **mitral valve:**
- If a valve does not close all of the way, it will make a _swishing sound_
- If a valve does not open all of the way, it will make a _clicking sound_



### Video 1.4a, The Cardiac Cycle, Part 1

Electrical Changes During the Cardiac Cycle

- **Conduction system**:
  - Starts at the SA node
    - Excitation of the atria creates the P-wave on an ECG
  - Signal sent to the AV node
    - Delayed for 1/10 th of a second—
  - Passed to AV bundle
    - The only electrical connection between the atrial syncytium and ventricular syncytium
  - Excitation of the ventricles creates the QRS complex on an ECG
  - Heart relaxes, ventricles repolarize
    - Creates the T wave on the ECG
- These electrical signals create changes in the contracting cells, triggering muscle contraction


### Video 1.4b: The Cardiac Cycle, Part 2

Pressure Changes During the Cardiac Cycle

- Pressure changes in the heart cause the valves to open and close, to prevent backflow of blood
  - The P wave on an ECG is followed closely by an increase in atrial pressure
    - atrial contraction, **atrial systole**
    - After atrial systole, the atria contract and pressure remains low
  - The QRS complex on an ECG is followed almost immediately by an increase in ventricular pressure
    - The period of ventricular contraction is called **ventricular systole**
    - When ventricular pressure exceeds aortic pressure, the semilunar valves open
      - Once this pressure peaks, the ventricles stop contracting
        - Pressure in ventricles falls below the pressure in the aorta and pulmonary trunk
      - The ventricles continue to relax and ventricular pressure continues to fall
        - When this pressure falls below atrial pressure, the AV valves open
        - The period when the ventricles are relaxed is called **ventricular diastole**–during this phase, ventricles fill with blood



Ventricular Volume During the Cardiac Cycle

- Ventricular volume is fairly high during relaxation, or **diastole**
- During atrial systole- a little more blood is pushed into the ventricles, so the volume increases slightly
- Ventricles contract, pressure increases and volume decreases
  - Blood is being ejected to the aorta and pulmonary trunk
  - AV valves open and ventricular volume begins to increase again



Heart Sounds During the Cardiac Cycle
  - Heart **sound one** indicates the start of ventricular systole
  - Heart **sound two** indicates start of ventricular diastole


### Video 1.4c: Assessing Pulse Demo

- **Heart rate**:
- **Pulse:**
  - We assess pulse in _elastic arteries_, which can distend and retract
  - Pulse and heart rate are typically the same in a person with healthy cardiovascular function, but could be different if someone has poor peripheral circulation or arterial disease



Locations to assess pulse:

- **carotid artery**
- **brachial artery**(at the antecubitalfossa)
- **radial artery**
- **femoral artery**
- **dorsalis pedis**
- **posterior tibial**



### Video 1.5:  Cardiac Output

- Need to keep blood circulating through the body to supply the cells with oxygen and nutrients and to carry away metabolic waste products
- **Cardiac Output (CO)**= the volume of blood ejected per minute
  - Influenced by _heart rate_ (HR) and _stroke volume_ (SV)
  - CO = HR x SV
- **Stroke volume:** the volume of blood ejected during a single heartbeat
  - **End diastolic volume**(EDV):
  - **End systolic volume**(ESV):
  - Stroke volume = EDV - ESV
- Cardiac output can be increased or decreased to meet the needs of the body
- The **autonomic nervous system** plays a role in regulating cardiac output
  - Two branches **: parasympathetic**and **sympathetic**
    - **sympathetic division:**
      - in the heart, the sympathetic nervous system innervates SA node, AV node and the contractile cells of the myocardium
      - when activated, causes the SA node to depolarize more quickly and can shorten the delay at the AV node
        - **tachycardia**= HR \&gt;100 bpm
      - sympathetic activation also causes contractile cells of myocardium to contract more forcefully -\&gt; leads to _increased stroke volume_
    - **parasympathetic division**:
      - in the heart, the parasympathetic nervous system innervates the SA node &amp; the AV node
      - parasympathetic nervous system slows the SA node&#39;s rate of self-excitation
        - parasympathetic signals are carried to the SA node by the **vagus nerve**
        - **bradycardia**= HR \&lt; 60 bpm


## Vital Signs 2 :  Blood Pressure

### Video 2.1:  Introduction to the Blood Vessels

Anatomy of the blood vessels

- Five types of blood vessels:
    - **arteries**
    - **arterioles**
    - **capillaries** – site of gas exchange
    - **venules**
    - **veins**
- Two circulations
    - **Systemic circulation:**
      - arteries carry blood to capillaries
      - in the capillary beds, oxygen (O2
  )leaves blood and moves to tissues and carbon dioxide (CO2) moves from the tissues to the blood
      - deoxygenated blood is then brought back to the right side of the heart through systemic veins
      - **aorta carries blood into the systemic circulation**
        - aorta branches into smaller arteries
        - branching continues until vessels are small enough that they are called **arterioles**
        - small arterioles carry blood to capillaries
        - capillaries converge to form **venules**
        - venules converge and form **veins**
- **Pulmonary circulation:**
  - pulmonary trunk carries deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary circulation
    - it branches into R. &amp; L. pulmonary arteries, which  carry blood to the R. &amp; L. lungs, respectively
    - gas exchange occurs in pulmonary capillaries
  - pulmonary veins carry oxygenatedblood back to the left side of the heart



### Video 2.2:  Blood Vessel Structure

All blood vessels except the capillaries have walls consisting of 3 layers

- **tunica intima**
  - innermost layer is called endothelium – it is continuous with endocardiumf the heart
  - thin, smooth tissue – low friction for blood flow
  - directly surrounds the **lumen** :
  - endothelium is the only tissue layer in capillaries
- **tunica media**
  - contains many elastic and smooth muscle fibers
    - elastic fibers - able to distend and retract
    - smooth muscle is arranged in concentric layers around the wall of the vessel
      - when the smooth muscle contracts, it causes the vessel diameter to decrease in size –this is called **vasoconstriction**
      - conversely, when the smooth muscle relaxes, the vessel diameter increases –this is called **vasodilation**
      - innervated by the _sympathetic nervous system_
        - even at rest, the sympathetic nervous system is sending signals to the vascular smooth muscle, causing a baseline level of vasoconstriction
        - higher level of sympathetic outflow, cause greater stimulation of the smooth muscle which can cause greater amount of vasoconstriction
- **tunica externa**
  - made of a layer of connective tissue
  - anchors the blood vessel in place and helps protect the outside of the vessel



Specific Type of Blood Vessels- Structure and Function

- 3 general types of arteries:
  - **elastic arteries**
    - closest to heart
    - tunica media contains relatively more elastic fibers
    - these large arteries have to be able to distend during ventricular systole to compensate for the surge of blood
    - then, the vessels retract during diastole, maintaining pressure which allows for a continuous flow of blood
    - **atherosclerosis**
  - **muscular arteries**
    - tunica media contains more smooth muscle
    - because there is more smooth muscle in the vessel walls, these vessels have a greater ability to vasoconstrict or vasodilate,, which allows them to channel blood to different organs or regions of the body
  - **arterioles**
    - large amount of smooth muscle in tunica media
      - very responsive to signals from the sympathetic nervous system in terms of vasoconstricting or vasodilating
    - these vessels have a big impact on **vascular resistance**
- **veins**
  - venous walls are always thinner than an arterial wall that is the same distance away from the heart
  - thin, collapsible walls which distend and collapse easily
  - veins have relatively large lumen diameters
  - due to the structure of veins, venous pressure is low


### Video 2.3:  Blood Circulation

Blood Circulation

- heart beats intermittently yet blood flows continuously（因为血管会突然舒张，以降低心脏负担；缓慢搜索，以稳定流动）
- **blood flow** =volume of blood that moves through a level of the vascular system per minute
  - blood flow is equal to cardiac output (CO)
  - blood flow is fairly constant under resting conditions
- **blood pressure** = force exerted per unit of surface area against the inner walls of a blood vessel
  - unit of measurement is millimeters of mercury (mmHg)
  - blood flows from region of high pressure to region of low pressure
- **resistance** = anything that opposes, or impedes, blood flow
  - most resistance is in the systemic circulation, away from heart –called **peripheral resistance**
  - influenced by several factors:
    - **vessel diameter**
      - #1 factor responsible for changes in vascular resistance
      - arterioles are most responsible for changes in peripheral resistance
    - **blood viscosity-** thickness or thinness of the blood
      - is fairly constant in healthy people
        - **anemia**
        - **polycythemia**
    - **vessel length**
      - pulmonary vs. systemic circulation-





### Video 2.4a:  Maintaining Blood Flow
- **pressure gradient** –difference in pressure from one part of the vascular system to another
  - blood flows _down_ its pressure gradient

- pressure across the systemic circulation
  - **systolic pressure (SBP)**
    - generated by ventricular contraction
    - = the highest pressure achieved in the large arteries
  - **diastolic pressure (DBP)**
    - achieved during ventricular relaxation
    - = the lowest pressure in the large arteries, achieved at the end of ventricular diastole
    - during diastole, elastic arteries retract to maintain pressure –diastolic pressure is lower than systolic pressure
  - **mean arterial pressure (MAP)**
    - highest MAP occurs in large arteries
    - lower in smaller arteries due to _increased resistance_
    - decreases across the capillary beds
    - lowest in the large veins close to the heart
- MAP continues to drop in the veins- several features help to maintain blood flow through the veins even though pressure is low
  - **venous valves** --prevent backward flow of blood
  - **skeletal muscles**
    - muscles bulge when contracted -- pushes on veins to send blood to heart
    - then, during muscular relaxation, venous valves prevent backflow
  - pressure changes in the thoracic cavity during breathing –lower thoracic cavity pressure during inhalation helps return blood to the heart



### Video 2.4b:  Assessing Blood Pressure Demonstration

To take a blood pressure:

- gather necessary equipment:
  - inflatable cuff attached to a **sphygmomanometer**
    - make sure the cuff is the correct size –if cuff size is wrong, the BP readings will not be accurate
  - stethoscope

- apply the cuff-
  - line up artery marker with brachial artery
  - cuff bottom should be in crook of the elbow (i.e., the antecubital fossa)



- taking the pressure
  - ideally, take the reading in the left arm and support the arm at the same level of the heart to get the most accurate reading
  - inflate the pump – this will cause cuff to inflate, occluding arteries under the cuff
    - arteries collapse, preventing blood flow
    - release gauge to deflate cuff
    - listen to brachial artery – will be quiet until blood flow is no longer occluded
      - **Korotkoff sounds**
    - note first sound and last sound
      - **systolic pressure** –corresponds to the first Korotkoff sound
      - **diastolic pressure** –sound of turbulent flow stops because blood is flowing smoothly through the artery again
      - blood pressure reading of 110 over 62 (110/62) –SBP is top number, DBP is bottom number


### Video 2.5:  Blood Pressure Regulation

Normal and abnormal blood pressure

- In healthy adults, systolic blood pressure should be no higher than 120 mmHg and diastolic should be less than 80 mmHg
- low blood pressure (hypotension)
  - typically not a problem unless it interferes with the ability to carry blood to the tissues



- **hypertension**---i.e., high blood pressure
  - can cause damage to blood vessel endothelium
    - ver time, leads to narrowing of lumen and blood flow restriction
  - damage to heart
    - increased workload
    - structural changes
  - we can have hypertension and not experience symptoms –because untreated hypertension can damage the cardiovascular system, it is important to have BP assessed regularly and treat hypertension



Factors affecting mean arterial pressure
- **cardiac output**
- **resistance**
  - arterioles create the most vascular resistance
  - **cardiovascular regulatory centers**—in brainstem
    - receive input from **baroreceptors** –these are sensors in blood vessel walls that detect the level of stretch in the blood vessel walls
    - regulate pressure by changing vessel diameter and cardiac output
- **blood volume**
  - normally is fairly constant
  - long term mechanisms involving hormonal regulation and kidney function can change blood volume which then lead to changes in blood pressure


## Vital Signs:  Metabolism

### Video 3.1:  Introduction to Metabolism

- **metabolism** –the combination of chemical reactions occurring in the body
  - two general types of chemical reactions comprise metabolism:
    - **catabolism** (decomposition reaction)
    - **anabolism** - (building reactions)
  - sum of all reactions   **metabolic rate**
- **macronutrients** are used to fuel the body-
  - fats-
    - triglycerides are the main dietary fat
    - made of mono glycerol and fatty acids
  - carbohydrates
    - sugars and starches
    - after digestion, we absorb simple sugars
    - primarily used to supply energy (ATP) to the body&#39;s cells
  - proteins
    - made of amino acids
    - used to build cellular proteins (e.g., muscle proteins) and can also be used catabolically to provide energy for the body
- after digestion, nutrients enter the blood and become part of the **nutrient pool**
- macronutrients are used to create cellular energy in the form of **adenosine triphosphate** (ATP) through **cellular respiration**
  - ATP is used to directly supply energy for chemical reactions that take place in the cells


### Video 3.2a:  Cellular Respiration, part 1

- **cellular respiration** -
  - begins with **glycolysis-**
    - glucose is broken down into pyruvic acid, then further converted (into acetyl-coA) and channeled to the Krebs Cycle
    - this set of reactions occurs in the cytoplasm of the cells
  - **Krebs cycle**
    - produces molecules that can be taken into the electron transport chain
    - ccurs in the mitochondria of the cells –produces CO2
  - **oxidative phosphorylation**
    - ccurs in the electron transport chain (also in the mitochondria)
    - yields a large amount of ATP –this is where O2 is used and H2O is generated
- **amino acids**
  - usually used anabolically to build new protein
  - can also be channeled into catabolic pathways and use for ATP production
- **triglycerides,** our main dietary lipid,are broken into
  - glycerol -- enters glycolysis
  - fatty acids -- converted to acetyl-CoA and channeled into the Krebs cycle



### Video 3.2b:  Cellular Respiration, part 2

- the glycolytic pathway can end two ways:

- **pyruvic acid**
  - end product of glycolysis when sufficient O2 is available
  - gets channeled into the Kreb&#39;s cycle
- **lactic acid**
  - forms when insufficient O2 is available
  - not a waste product
    - cardiac muscle cells can use lactic acid -\&gt; convert back to pyruvic acid to use in the Kreb&#39;s cycle
    - liver can use lactic acid to build new glucose molecules
- cellular respiration summarized chemically by the formula
  - C6H12O6(glucose) + 6 O2(oxygen) ---> 6 H2O(water) + 6 CO2(carbon dioxide) + up to 30 ATP
  - if insufficient oxygen, glycolysis yields 2 lactic acid + 2 ATP
- **ATP-** adenosine molecule with  phosphate groups attached
  - 2 terminal phosphate groups are attached to the molecule with **high-energy phosphate bonds**

- cellular respiration is not totally efficient at capturing the energy stored in a fuel –as a result heat is also released





### Video 3.3:  Assessing Metabolic Rate Demonstration

- assessing metabolic rate
  - measure oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production
  - oxygen consumption (VO2) is proportional to ATP production
    - **VO2**
    - **respiratory exchange ratio (RER)**
      - RER –is calculated as follows VCO2/VO2
        - where VCO2 = the rate of CO2 production and VO2 = the rate of O2 consumption
        - can be used to determine what type of substrate is being consumed
      - ranges from 0.7 to 1
        - an RER of 0.7 indicates that fats are the main fuel source
        - higher ratio tells us a greater proportion of carbohydrates are being consumed
        - an RER of 1.0 or higher indicates that carbohydrates are the predominant fuel source
    - **METs** = metabolic rate (actually stands for &quot;metabolic equivalent of task&quot;)
      - METs increase as energy consumption increases
        - 1 MET represents a resting metabolic rate
        - 6 METs indicates that one&#39;s metabolic rate is 6 times higher than the metabolic rate at rest
        - during vigorous exercise, MET level can rise to 12-20
      - when the MET level goes up, heat production will also increase



### Video 3.4:  Metabolic Lab Discussion

- **resting metabolic rate**
- metabolic rate increases with activity
  - VO2 and VCO2 increase –as a result of the increase in cellular respiration
  - respiratory rate increases \&gt; more gas exchange in lungs


## Vital Signs:  Body Temperature

### Video 4.1:  Introduction to Thermoregulation

-  **metabolic rate:** measure of all of the chemical reactions going on in the body at a given time
  - certain organs have continuous rate of metabolism that contributes significantly to establishing our resting metabolic rate --e.g., the heart, brain, liver, kidneys
  - **body core** –the internal region of body where we normally maintain a fairly constant temperature
  - heat is released with an increase in metabolic rate because cells are not 100% efficient –increased metabolism, as occurs during exercise, creates more heat
  - **core body temperature-**
    - **normal range** : 35.8°C-38.2°C
    - normal core temperatures vary between individuals and throughout the day
      - lowest during-
      - highest during-
    - important to maintain a normal temperature for optimal enzyme activity-
  - **body shell**
    - more temperature fluctuation occurs in the body shell
      - based on atmospheric temperature and body&#39;s metabolic rate
    - blood – mechanism of heat transfer in body
      - picks up heat in body core \&gt; carries heat to less metabolically active parts of body

- types of heat transfer:
  - **conduction**
  - **radiation**
  - **convection**
    - body heat will transfer to the cold fluid, which will then rise away from the body surface and be replaced by cooler fluid
    - the cooler fluid will warm (due to heat transfer from the body) –and then it will rise away from the body surface
    - the greater the temperature gradient between the body and the cool fluid that replaces the warm fluid, the greater will be the heat loss
    - **wind chill**
  - **evaporation**
    - heat is required to vaporize water (called the &quot;heat of vaporization&quot;)
      - it is not sweating _per se_ that makes us feel cooler –it is the evaporation of sweat that cools us
      - when sweat evaporates, it is body heat that vaporizes the water in sweat
    - **heat index**
- heat loss from the body can be sensible or insensible:
  - **sensible heat loss-**
    - example:  sweating
  - **insensible heat loss-**
    - example:  evaporation that occurs as air moves past the airway surfaces during inhalation


### Video 4.2:  Maintaining Body Temperature

Reflex arc:

- all reflex arcs begin with a **sensory receptor** –the temperature sensors of the body are called **thermoreceptors**
  - peripheral thermoreceptors
    - sensitive to hot and cold
    - peripheral thermoreceptors provide the information which helps us cope with environmental temperature changes
    - body has high water content which creates **thermal inertia** –peripheral thermoreceptors make the brain aware of changes in environmental temperature so that adjustments can be made to maintain core temperature
  - central thermoreceptors
- neurons carry the sensory input to the **hypothalamus** , which is the **control center** for body temperature regulation
  - temperature control center is located in the **preoptic nucleus** of the hypothalamus
- **motor effects** allow us to maintain our temperature
  - **temperature homeostasis** –state of dynamic equilibrium in which we maintain our body core temperature within the normal range (35.8°C-38.2°C)
  - decreased body temperature –when body temperature falls below the hypothalamic set point it causes:
    - vasoconstriction of subcutaneous blood vessels
    - shivering-
      - the slight shaking or shuddering that we call &quot;shivering&quot; is due to rapid involuntary muscle contractions
      - remember:  about 60% of the energy stored in the molecular bonds of fuel molecules is released as heat
      - thus, as skeletal muscles generate ATP to fuel shivering, they also generate a lot of heat
    - hormonal secretion
      - in prolonged cold, hormones can stimulate metabolism &amp; help to maintain a normal body temperature
  - increased body temperature – body/blood is warmer than the hypothalamic set point
    - vasodilation of subcutaneous blood vessels
      - increases heat loss via radiation (and possibly convection)
    - sweating
  - **negative feedback** is built into the temperature regulating system


### Video 4.3:  Hypothermia &amp; Hyperthermia

-  **hypothermia –** condition in which the body core temperature falls below the normal range
  - normal physiological mechanisms to warm body (constriction of subcutaneous blood vessels, shivering) are not enough to raise body temperature back to the normal range
  - manifestations-
    - decreased heart rate
    - decreased respiration rate
    - decreased blood pressure
    - brain functions will also begin to fail if the hypothermia become severe enough and/or prolonged
  - interventions-
-  **hyperthermia:**
  - varies in severity
    - **heat exhaustion**
      - blood cannot circulate effectively due to blood volume loss from excessive sweating
      - conflicting signals
      - can occur after prolonged exercise in heat
      - manifestations
      - interventions:
    - **heat stroke** –condition is more severe than heat exhaustion
      - positive feedback cycle created that generates heat loss mechanisms that _worsen_ the condition
      - manifestations:
        - hot, dry skin
        - rgans shut down (i.e., organ failure)
      - predisposing factors can put some people at higher risk:
        - lder adults
        - young children and neonates
        - people with cardiovascular disease-
        - pregnant women-
        - people who have impaired fluid regulation capability (as in chronic kidney failure)-
      - interventions:


### Video 4.4:  Fever

-  **Fever:**
  - **pyrogens –** molecules released by the cells of the immune system that have the ability to raise the hypothalamic set point
    - released by cells of the immune system (mainly) and can circulate in the blood
    - when they arrive in the brain, they affect hypothalamic function
    - when hypothalamus set point is increased, the higher body temperature of a fever is interpreted by the hypothalamus as &quot;normal&quot;
  - may feel cool despite high temperature
  - a fever &quot;breaks&quot; when the pyrogens are removed from body and hypothalamus returns to normal set point
  - fever is not always a bad thing



### Video 4.5:  Assessing Body Temperature Demo

- Types of thermometers-
  - **oral**
    - place probe of thermometer in **sublingual pocket-**
      - close to **sublingual artery** – a deep artery, which gives a more accurate measure of core body temperature
  - **temporal**
    - run probe over patient&#39;s forehead –assesses temperature in **temporal artery** , which also carries blood a short distance from the core and gives a relatively accurate measure of core temperature
  - **tympanic**
    - placed in external auditory canal against **tympanic membrane** (or ear drum)
      - close to hypothalamus --thus, gives a fairly accurate measure of core temperature
  - **axillary**
    - measured in **axilla** (or armpit)
      - it is difficult to get an accurate reading at this site, for various reasons
  - **rectal**
    - sensor probe is placed in rectum
    - requires practice and training for accurate readings
- important to take a temperature when patient is healthy –then, are able to compare future readings to this baseline temperature
